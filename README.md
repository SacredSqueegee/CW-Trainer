# CW Trainer
---

This is very much a work in progress but a usable work in progress at this point.

The goal of this project is to build an easy an intuitive python application for learning CW (morse code). This application is heavily centered around the Farnsworth method of training and allows flexibility with many configurations (with many more to come in the future).

My main goal with this application is to polish and add more features to it as I progress through the learning process of CW.

As I'm not considering this a full release right now (it is usable) there is no documentation at this point, but hopefully the user interface is intuitive enough to get you on your way.

You will need the following libraries installed via pip to run the application:
- PyQt5
- pygame
- numpy
- matplotlib

Simply run the appliication with `python main.py`

On first launch the application will take a minute or two to pre-build resources but subsequint launches should be instant.
